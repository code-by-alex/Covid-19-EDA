Project Overview: Exploratory Data Analysis of COVID-19 Impact in Developed Countries (Up to October 2022)

In this project, I aim to conduct a comprehensive exploratory data analysis of COVID-19 data spanning from the initial collection to October 2022. The primary focus is on understanding the dynamics of COVID-related deaths and the percentage of the population that has been vaccinated across several larger developed countries.

Objectives:

•	Insights into COVID-19 Deaths: Analyzing data to uncover patterns and trends in COVID-related fatalities.
•	Vaccination Coverage: Examining the percentage of the population that has been vaccinated in each country.
•	Country-Specific Impact: Understanding how COVID-19 has affected larger developed countries individually.
•	Identification of Hotspots: Identifying countries with the highest infection rates and exploring the percentage of deaths relative to the infected population.

Key Components:

•	Time Frame: Data analysis will cover the period from the commencement of data collection to October 2022.
•	Country Selection: Focusing on larger developed countries to provide a comprehensive perspective.
•	Infection Rates: Identifying and analyzing countries with the highest infection rates.
•	Vaccination Impact: Evaluating the correlation between vaccination coverage and the severity of the pandemic.
•	This project aims to contribute valuable insights into the impact of COVID-19 on larger developed countries, shedding light on the effectiveness of vaccination efforts and providing a nuanced understanding of the pandemic's trajectory up to October 2022.
