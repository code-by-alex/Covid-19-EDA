Data Analyst: Alex Carran

Purpose: 
In this project I will be conducting exploratory data analysis of Covid 19 data ranging from the beginning of data collected to October of 2022. The goal of this project is to gather insights on covid related deaths and percentage of population that had been vaccinated. I will be looking at data from some of the larger developed countries and how covid had affected each. I will be able to find countries with the highest infection rates and percentage of deaths based on those who were infected.
